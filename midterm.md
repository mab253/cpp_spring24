# ðŸ“¡ midterm groundrules

The midterm exam is **take-home.** You will have access to the assignment labeled "Midterm Exam" in zyBooks by 3pm on Wednesday 03.27.24, and you will be able to work on it on your own time anytime before it's due on Friday 03.29.24, at 12pm.

The midterm is take home and open book so that you can spend as much time as you need, in the place you need, with the tools that help you do well.

## you may:

- Look @ zyBooks for reference, documentation
- Use resources linked in the syllabus
- Use class notes, slides, code from class
- Submit multiple times (just like labs)
- Use all the time you need until deadline

## you may not:

- Turn in the mid-term late
- Work with others; ask others for help; this is solo work
- Use search engines or websites to search _specifically for problems + solutions_
- Use ChatGPT, other generative AI tools to code solutions

I will be using similarity checker tools to check to see if student work resembles others, and also if student work resembles online and AI-generated content. Using the internet to copy solutions, plagiarizing others' code, and sharing exams are all violations of the [academy honesty policy](http://www.cuny.edu/about/administration/offices/legal-affairs/policies-resources/academic-integrity-policy/), and may result in serious consequences, including failing the exam and possibly failing the course.

## on functions that we have not used in class:

ðŸ¤– You may **not** use methods outside of what we've learned in class, **unless you cite them and make comments about them in your code.**

There are usually many, many ways to solve the same problem! But for this exam, we're looking for an understanding of the foundational methods we've been studying. That said, if you have studied another C++ function or technique and you want to incorporate that into your code, you may use this **if you make a citation** about where you learned this method in your code comments, and explain a little bit about **why you chose to use this method over a technique that we learned this semester**.

For example:
- using #include <algorithm>, or other #include headers that we haven't used
- using `.reverse`, `.begin()`, `.end()`
- using `.map()`
- using `char&`

Solutions that use such methods _without citation/explanation_ will lose points. Worth remembering: every problem on the midterm can be solved using the functions and methods we've used in class so far!
